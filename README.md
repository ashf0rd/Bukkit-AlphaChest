# AlphaChest #
A CraftBukkit (Minecraft) plugin. Virtual chests. Always, everywhere.

## Updates ##
Took FatDemon's code and just added some edits that let people open non-UUID chests (so chests that aren't associated with a player... like virtual-virtual chests?). So doing /chest Zak
would open up my character's chest (UUID name like 2475d58b-e26b-4d00-81dc-621d9b0d34ae.chest.yml). Now let's say I want to store fireworks for my admins with alphachest.admin, I'll
just do /chest fireworks and it'll open up the non-UUID fireworks chest (fireworks.chest.yml).
